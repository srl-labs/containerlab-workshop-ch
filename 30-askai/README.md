# Install SRL-GPT and use AskAI

In this lab, you will install SRL-GPT, an AI assistant application installed on Nokia’s SR Linux OS that connects to OpenAI 4o large language model to let you ask natural-language questions about network configuration, logs, and state. Once installed, you’ll interact with it via prompts prefixed with askai (e.g. askai Which interfaces are up? or askai Show me configured IP interfaces), making it easier to learn SR Linux concepts, explore configuration details, and retrieve operational information without relying on traditional CLI syntax.

> [!CAUTION]
> Before proceeding, please destroy all other labs to free up the memory  
> `clab des -c -a` - destroys all running labs and removes their respective lab dirs

Start with copying the Containerlab lab-examples to the working directory:

```bash
cd ~/clab-workshop_snr
cp -r /etc/containerlab/lab-examples /home/user/clab-workshop_snr/
```

## Deploy the srl02 lab example

```bash
clab dep -t ~/clab-workshop_snr/lab-examples/srl02
```

Check if the lab is running

```bash
clab ins -a
```

## Deploying the SRL-GPT app on clab-srl02-srl1

Login on clab-srl02-srl1

```bash
ssh clab-srl02-srl1
```

The SRL-GPT app can be installed with a single command 'sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y srlgpt' that is executed in the SR Linux bash.

```bash
bash sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y srlgpt
```

Check if the askai-server is running:

```bash
show system application askai-server
```
Output should look like this:
```
A:admin@srl1# show system application askai-server
  +--------------+------+---------+---------+--------------------------+
  |     Name     | PID  |  State  | Version |       Last Change        |
  +==============+======+=========+=========+==========================+
  | askai-server | 5677 | running | 1.0.106 | 2025-10-05T16:55:37.505Z |
  +--------------+------+---------+---------+--------------------------+
```

Logout and log back is onto `clab-srl02-srl1` 

```bash
A:admin@srl1# quit
```
```
Connection to clab-srl02-srl1 closed.
```
```bash
ssh clab-srl02-srl1
```

## Configure the askai-server parameters

First, retrieve the openai key which you can find on the server by running the following command on the host server:

```bash
cat ~/keys/openai_key.txt
```

```bash
enter candidate
askai-server openai-key "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
askai-server model-version gpt-4
askai-server dynamic-state true
commit stay
```

## Ask the first question and accept the terms

Now that the askai-server parameters are configured, you can start asking questions using natural language

```
A:admin@srl1# askai who are you?
```

Accept the terms of the end user aggreement
```
Please go through all terms of end user agreement and Press any key to continue...

Do you accept the terms (yes/no): yes
```
Example questions:

A:admin@srl1# askai how can I configure ospf ?
To configure OSPF on SR Linux, you need to set up the following minimal parameters:

1. Set the OSPF version to either OSPF version 2 or version 3. If you're configuring OSPFv3, you must also specify the address family to be used, either IPv4 or IPv6.

2. Define the OSPF instance ID. This is necessary when configuring multiple instances or if the instance being configured is not the base instance.

3. Define the router ID on the router. This ID is used by both OSPF protocol in the routing table manager. When you configure a new router ID, OSPF is automatically disabled and re-enabled to initialize the new router ID.

4. Create at least one OSPF area.

5. Assign an interface to each OSPF area.

Here is an example of a basic OSPF configuration using CLI flat SET commands:

set / network-instance default protocols ospf instance default admin-state enable
set / network-instance default protocols ospf instance default version ospf-v2
set / network-instance default protocols ospf instance default router-id 10.10.10.1
set / network-instance default protocols ospf instance default area 0.0.0.0 interface ethernet-1/1.10
set / network-instance default protocols ospf instance default area 0.0.0.0 interface ethernet-1/1.10 interface-type point-to-point


This configuration sets the OSPF version to OSPFv2, defines the router ID as 10.10.10.1, creates an OSPF area with the ID 0.0.0.0, and assigns the interface ethernet-1/1.10 to this area. The interface type is set to point-to-point.

```

Use AskAi to learn SR Linux.
